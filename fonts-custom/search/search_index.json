These families were chosen because the  Noto fonts are well documented and they are available under the  Open Font License.</p> <p>In this example, the fonts are loaded from a CDN (that is not Google) to keep the example itself small and allow you to use it as a template for your own site, without assuming what fonts you might want to use. We also describe how to use custom fonts that are hosted on your own server, see below.</p> <p>Here we have some text in:</p> <ul> <li>Noto Serif</li> <li>Noto Serif bold</li> <li>Noto Serif italic</li> <li>Noto Serif bold italic</li> <li><code>Noto Mono</code></li> <li><code>Noto Mono bold</code> </li> </ul> <p>Privacy Plugin</p> <p>Before you consider the examples below, you should know that loading fonts or other assets from a CDN may bring you into non-compliance with data protection legislation such as the GDPR in the EU. You can read more about this in the ensuring data privacy section of the documentation.</p> <p>The privacy plugin provided by Material for MkDocs provides a best-of-both-worlds solution in that it allows you to specify fonts available on Google Fonts directly in your <code>mkdocs.yml</code>.  It automatically downloads the ones used and includes them in your website so they are served up together with your documentation.  No need for a custom stylesheet.</p>"},{"location":"#how-it-works","title":"How it works","text":"<p>In <code>mkdocs.yml</code>, turn off the auto-loading of fonts from Google Fonts and add an extra CSS stylesheet to configure your custom fonts.</p> <pre><code>theme:\n  font: false\n\nextra_css:\n  - assets/stylesheets/extra.css\n</code></pre> <p>Then, configure custom fonts hosted either on a CDN or on your own server, depending on your needs. We demonstrate this here with the  Noto Sans and Noto Mono font families.</p>"},{"location":"#using-a-cdns-css","title":"Using a CDN's CSS","text":"<p>If you are using a CDN to load your fonts, you may want to use CSS that the operators of the CDN are providing for defining the font faces, instead of writing your own. You still need to configure the fonts for Material to use, though:</p> <code>mkdocs.yml</code><code>extra.css</code> <pre><code>extra_css:\n  - https://fonts.cdnfonts.com/css/noto-serif\n  - https://fonts.cdnfonts.com/css/noto-mono\n  - assets/stylesheets/extra.css\n</code></pre> <pre><code>:root {\n  --md-text-font: \"Noto Serif\";\n  --md-code-font: \"Noto Mono\";\n}\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"#hosting-on-your-own-site","title":"Hosting on your own site","text":"<p>The code for hosting the fonts yourself as part of your site, looks very similar to the previous example that used a CDN. You need to write your own font face definitions and point the browser  to the files located on your own server, e.g., in <code>docs/assets/fonts</code>:</p> <code>mkdocs.yml</code><code>extra.css</code> <pre><code>extra_css:\n  - assets/stylesheets/extra.css\n</code></pre> <pre><code>@font-face {\n  font-family: \"Noto Serif\"; \n  font-weight: normal; \n  font-style: normal;\n  src: url(\"../fonts/NotoSerif-Regular.otf\");\n}\n\n@font-face {\n  font-family: \"Noto Serif\"; \n  font-weight: bold; \n  font-style: normal;\n  src: url(\"../fonts/NotoSerif-Bold.otf\");\n\n}\n\n@font-face {\n  font-family: \"Noto Serif\"; \n  font-weight: normal; \n  font-style: italic;\n  src: url(\"../fonts/NotoSerif-Italic.otf\");\n\n}\n\n@font-face {\n  font-family: \"Noto Mono\"; \n  font-weight: normal; \n  font-style: normal;\n  src: url(\"../fonts/NotoSansMono-Regular.otf\");\n\n}\n\n@font-face {\n  font-family: \"Noto Mono\"; \n  font-weight: bold; \n  font-style: normal;\n  src: url(\"../fonts/NotoSansMono-Bold.otf\");\n}\n\n:root {\n  --md-text-font: \"Noto Serif\";\n  --md-code-font: \"Noto Mono\";\n}\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"#dis-advantages","title":"(Dis-)Advantages","text":"<p>If you are loading the fonts from a CDN as in this example, you are still not limiting traffic to only your website.
