# Examples

The examples in this repository augment the documentation of Material for 
MkDocs by providing worked examples of the functionality it provides. There
are also extended examples showing common integrations with third-party plugins 
or that demonstrate specific use cases.

Our aim is to cover all the options that are supported by Material for MkDocs 
so that the examples can be used as a basis for new projects or [reproductions]. 

Note that some options might currently be reserved for [sponsors]. We aim to 
indicate this in the tags that are displayed with each examples but please
check the list of [available features] to be sure.
