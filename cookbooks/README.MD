# Cookbooks

What are cookbooks? In short: they are somewhat more complex examples
demonstrating specific use cases rather than demonstrating specific
features. This means they will involve interactions between multiple
features, often features from different plugins, both internal to
Material for MkDocs and external to it.

For this reason, cookbooks are to be considered to be *more fragile*.
While we take care to keep examples running at all times, the same
would be impossible to do with cookbooks, so your mileage may vary
when relying on them.

That said, we intend to use cookbooks as smoke tests for Material, so
we do become aware at least of cases where they fail to build. We rely
on the community to inform us if they break in other ways. So, if you
find that a specific cookbook fails to build, please let us know.

**TODO: define feedback mechanism**

Since cookbooks are more complex, they also require additional
explanation beyond what the Material for MkDocs documentation provides.

**TODO: should people build the cookbook to read the documentation or
should we host this somewhere?**
