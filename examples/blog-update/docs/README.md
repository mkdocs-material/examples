# A blog with update dates shown

This example shows how to add a small customization that will show
then blob posts were [updated] on the blog index pages. (The blog page
template already contains this.)


If you have not already set up a blog for your site then please start
with the [Basic blog] example.

It shows how to:

- add an update date in addition to the creation date for a post as in [My first post]
- override the template index pages, so
  that the [main blog index], the [archive index] and the [categories
  index] show the update date

[Basic blog]: ../blog-basic
[My first post]: blog/2023/10/11/my-first-blog-post
[main blog index]: blog
[archive index]: blog/archive/2023
[categories index]: blog/category/meta
