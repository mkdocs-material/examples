# Creating a standalone blog

Sometimes it is desirable to set up a website that has a blog as its central
feature. Rather than being embedded into a wider website with its own complex
structure, the blog structure organizes most of the content.

This example shows how set up such a blog using the [blog plugin].

It shows how to:

- configure the `mkdocs.yml` to activate and configure the plugin 
- set up navigation to prominently feature the blog structure
- set up a directory structure in your `docs/` folder
- add an `.authors.yml` file with author information

The naming of the files containing the blog posts is just a
suggestion, you can name them any way you like. What matters is the
meta data at in the header.
