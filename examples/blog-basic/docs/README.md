# Adding a blog to your site

This example shows how to add a [blog] to your site. It shows how to:

- configure the `mkdocs.yml` to activate and configure the plugin 
- set up a directory structure in your `docs/` folder
- add an `.authors.yml` file with author information

The naming of the files containing the blog posts is just a
suggestion, you can name them any way you like. What matters is the
meta data at in the header.
