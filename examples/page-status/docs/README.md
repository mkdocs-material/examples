# Using page status

This example shows how to add a [page status] to a page. This works for section
index pages as well as regular pages.

You can add the existing status identifiers `new` and `deprecated` but also
define custom ones by:

1. Defining the tooltip in your `mkdocs.yml`
2. Defining the icon to use in your [`extra.css`][extra.css]
